module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"errors\":{\"AccessControlBadConfirmation()\":[{\"details\":\"The caller of a function is not the expected one.

Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/interfaces/Interfaces.sol\":\"IERC721Extented\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"details\":{\"constantOptimizer\":false,\"cse\":false,\"deduplicate\":false,\"inliner\":false,\"jumpdestRemover\":false,\"orderLiterals\":false,\"peephole\":false,\"yul\":true,\"yulDetails\":{\"optimizerSteps\":\"dhfoDgvulfnTUtnIf[xa[r]EscLMcCTUtTOntnfDIulLculVcul [j]Tpeulxa[rul]xa[r]cLgvifCTUca[r]LSsTFOtfDnca[r]Iulc]jmul[jul] VcTOcul jmul:fDnTOc\",\"stackAllocation\":true}},\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc6a8ff0ea489379b61faa647490411b80102578440ab9d84e9a957cc12164e70\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0ea104e577e63faea3b69c415637e99e755dcbf64c5833d7140c35a714d6d90c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmau6x4Ns9XdyynRCNNp3RhLqijJjFm7z5fyZazfYFGYdq\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x5ef46daa3b58ef2702279d514780316efaa952915ee1aa3396f041ee2982b0b4\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://2f8f2a76e23b02fc69e8cd24c3cb47da6c7af3a2d6c3a382f8ac25c6e094ade7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPV4ZS4tPVv4mTCf9ejyZ1ai57EEibDRj7mN2ARDCLV5n\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4296879f55019b23e135000eb36896057e7101fb7fb859c5ef690cf14643757b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://87b3541437c8c443ccd36795e56a338ed12855eec17f8da624511b8d1a7e14df\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeJQCtZrQjtJLr6u7ZHWeH3pBnjtLWzvRrKViAi7UZqxL\"]},\"contracts/interfaces/Interfaces.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcee038fff82ea087fcca9ccabcc0e8e8d98fe8e907c3d781e16b653badd7bd42\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8437b64a0e7587e2d0ab0f37767f9be8bce72b41ecb3c340940a301f35422f48\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYy6hA9PY78CDsq71zPsYxBKJxGgSSpSmhXSW4kSLke4a\"]}},\"version\":1}","evm":{"legacyAssembly":null,"assembly":null,"bytecode":null,"methodIdentifiers":{"approve(address,uint256)":"095ea7b3","balanceOf(address)":"70a08231","getApproved(uint256)":"081812fc","isApprovedForAll(address,address)":"e985e9c5","ownerOf(uint256)":"6352211e","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)":"42842e0e","safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes)":"b88d4fde","setApprovalForAll(address,bool)":"a22cb465","supportsInterface(bytes4)":"01ffc9a7","tokensOfOwner(address)":"8462151c","transferFrom(address,address,uint256)":"23b872dd"}},"irOptimized":""}}}}}
